# Unittest module that reports reference leaks

This module is a replacement for the unittest.py model in Python 2.6. This
differs from the standard Python 2.6 unittest in that it checks reference
counts going into and coming out of each test. If the reference count for a
test is not neutral upon cleanup of that test, an error is reported for that
test with the number of references leaked. This is useful for finding reference
leaks in well-tested c extensions.
